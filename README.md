<br>



<ol>

<li>Click the "Download Zip" button (should be to the right of this screen and under the "Clone in desktop" button)</li>

<li>Right click the newly downloaded file and click the "Extract All" button and accept/continue any windows that come up (It's may be under "Compressed Folder Tools", also choose a destination and remember it!)</li>

<li>Open Google Chrome (It would help to have the latest version)</li>

<li>Into the top website bar thing type "chrome://extensions"</li>

<li>Click the checkbox that says "Developer Mode" (should be at the top and slightly to the right)</li>

<li>Click the button that says "Load unpacked extension"</li>

<li>Find the directory that you placed the unziped file in (When you first open the directory there will be a folder, it is that folder that you must select/use)</li>

<li>Make sure that the "Enabled" check box is checked and it wouldn't be a bad idea to close and re-open chrome</li>

<li>Log onto membean</li>

<li>Start a session, kick back & relax!</li>

</ol>

<p>The code purposely doesn't do anything on the new word pages<p>

<br>



<p>This "hack" is not illegal, it simply reads the client side markup of membean and clicks a few buttons and inserts some stuff into text boxes</p>



<br>



<p>This is not intended to insult or embarrass any school and/or education officials</p>
